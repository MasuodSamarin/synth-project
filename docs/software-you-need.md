# Software you need to use synth

## Operating system 
As your operating system is able to run python 3, you can use this piece of software. I personally use Ubuntu GNU/Linux and Windows(R) 10. I had no problems with these two operating systems. 
Also, you need to be sure that your operating system supports `numpy` and `scipy` or not. 

## End-User software 
1. A media player (for playing `.wav` files this synth produces)
2. Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) - it's optional, but if you want to see wave form and even use wave files as samples in your music, it's necessary. For monitoring and testing the results, I suggest **Audacity**
3. Text editor
